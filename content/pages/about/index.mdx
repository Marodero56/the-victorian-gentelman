Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening,

I'm a student making an informational page about what it's like to be a victorian gentelmen in the style of lifestyle and dating advice. 

This is my first full web project. It's a static site that's being generated by Gatsby and hosted on Vercel. Since, it's gatsby the javascript framework is going to have be React.
However, I'm mostly using mdx to create new pages instead of coding each page indivually using javascript.
The asthetic theme is one from @LekoArts.

I'm writing this right now at 22:45 on Thursday and procastinating righting any more articles.
I also need to actually host this on vercel before I forget... ðŸ—¿
