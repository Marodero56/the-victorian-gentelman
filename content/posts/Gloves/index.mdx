During the day a Gentelman should wear gloves made of kid and they must be an appropiate length for his hand.

For the evening, the animal skin is no longer an issue but they must not be silk or cotton.

Once seated at dinner, a Gentelman should takes of his gloves and lay them on his lap underneath his napkin so they don't get dirty.

After Dinner, the Gentelman should wash his hands with a finger glass, dry them, them put his gloves back on discretly underneath the table.
