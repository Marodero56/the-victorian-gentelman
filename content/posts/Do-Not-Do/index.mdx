Sometimes's it feels like there's a lot of unwritten rules about being a gentelman. So why don't we write them down.

## Never use a first name in public

## Don't use profanities or speak of impolite subjects infront of a lady

## Don't lower your eyelids when you bow

## Don't talk behind someone's back

## Don't take conflicting opinions

## Don't window shop

## Don't deliver your own parcels, have them delivered for you.
